Meeting 17/06/16
SDG and Doug Present
Doug recently returned from India, caught him up with work.
Had 2 previous meeting with SDG to sort out Maths section
Gave both a draft of Paper - DP to read on flight to India

Centered Averaged Figures (requested by Alison);
- understand why theta is high, but w is not ; pulse of heating is widespread and remains in box for longer. w is superposition of subsidence on upward mode until subsidence mode has left domain.
- try trapped solution - will giver better understanding. SDG: "should be able to predict shapes"
- Play around with C, T, L. Can reach some maximum where is levels off. Trapped case is single subsidence mode so much neater. (?)
- "growing warming as gravity wave evolves, but levels off".
- Might be worth putting in paper, depending on outcome

Contours of w for range of N2;
- try for theta or energy flux
- 2 clearly different dynamical regimes.
- SDG; " worried about N2 = 0 as it is hydrostatic"
- Check resonance for the peak. Maybe lid a has resonance at N2 ~= 2.3. 
- How does this translate in Scorer anaylsis? In Scorer formulation, wind curvature will cancel with N, so may be relevent in certain situations (i.e. some upper level wind)
- One diagnosis real trapping by investigate Scorer parameter with height. 
- look at longer times. 3/6/12/...
- SDG: "when N2 << 1, may be that heating projects onto deeper modes preferentially, which is why we see faster response?". Look at fields to try and explain why it's moving faster with N2 < N1.
