Meeting 23/11/2015;
Doug's office. 
SDG, DP present

Presented lastest convergence document.
Discussed literature.

Convergence;
- Seemed happy
- would like to see final 2 panels in large (too see detail)

Fourier decomposition plots;
- DP; do it for H_l = 2

Literature;
- well documented stratospheric gravity waves, we're interested in troposphere
- No qualitative results
- Shutts has done rotation, but not sensitivity to lid
- None discuss sensitivity to aspect ratio (R)
- read Bretherton paper
- Many are warm bubble forcing (basically kick off with small temp perturbation)
- Nicholls demonstrates what's going on with mode 1 and 2. Lane and Reeder proclaim 3 is important. 

Questions of interest;
- horizontal spatial decay rate of w?
- changes in troposphere 
- How are gravity waves represented in models (ask S. Vosper). SDG; some models on B or C grids can't get gravity waves when on grid scale (horizontal C_g -> 0 !).

Writing;
- Begin writing paper
- Try and have first draft done by Xmas (??!?!!)
- Start by thinking about objectives. Have these at end of introduction.
- Be v. specific in title; people will think all gravity waves stuff has been done. 
- DP; Title to mention "tropospheric response", "horizontal characteristics", "remote response" . 
- would be good to get rotation (perhaps not by xmas)
- DP; would be an great bit of work, submit to JAS or quarterly
- Need to explain why we are going simpler than the literature.

General;
- Q4 of "Research Q's" - make reference to parameterisation scheme
- SDG; would be good to have understanding of how convergence plots and Fourier plots fit together.
- DP; Altering aspect ratio is a pseudo stratification (since we are altering C_g - so too would strafication). 
- Typical aspect ratio would be 1, which would alter the followin mathematics. DP; Tidy that up. Algebraic expressions for different cases (large R, small R, unity (?)).
