DP, SDG present

Subject; Convergence of w solution

Presented document detailing C_g, timescale of valid solutions as well as difference plots. 

Difference;
- This is absolute difference, might be good to do relative or RMS
- Plot in bottom part of domain, not whole(!)
- check order of sigma convergence? How does altering sigma affect things? Understand these plots fully before we move on. Check plot makes sense!
- What's the non-dimensionalisation? 
- DP; these are showing amplitude not stucture. We want to observe structure consistent across different lids. 
- DP; Important to understand these things, but we are interested in studying at one data point. 
- plot in log_10
- At short times, why are errors different?
- want to know gradient of curves

C_g
- can have negative wavenumbers, so there are 4 responses. Classic picture from Turner(?)

Extra Comments;
SDG;
- What are we seeing at long times? Where are maximum errors?
- At short times, we have a large w field (before it moves off), does this explain difference plots?
- Once you understand C_g, we may be able to quantitively understand difference plots. 
DP;
- Expecting to see smaller angle from horizontal in wider heating cases.
