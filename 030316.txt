Meeting 03/03/2016
DP, SDG present
Discussed new plots, extensions to theory (lifting Boussinesq) and MO collabs

General;
- Arrange telecon with Rachel Stretton, Alison Stirling, DP and SDG. Doug meeting Alison nest Thurs (10/03/16).
- SDG; lifting Boussinesq would change details but would be worth it. Will address first order reviewer notes. 

2-Layer (N1, N2);
- Check N2 value. Look at possibility of using US standard atmosphere. 
- Need CAPE line plots, hovmollers, etc., for full story. 

Triggering criteria;
- have as up/down warm/cold in 4 combos.
- Think about relevency to big questions
- Tephigram arguments for high CAPE/reduced CIN
- Think about units in plot. Usually go for energy (convert w to kinetic). 

Remote time series;
- have at 2km, not tropospheric average
