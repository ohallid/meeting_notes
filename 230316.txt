Meeting 23/03/16
DP, SDG present
Discussed latest figures from development of deep atmosphere

General;
- check \rho term in on all modes (I think it is). Perterbation fields should have exponential term. 
- where does scale height come in? Scale height is detemined by N (and g). Set N, infer H.
- Tidy code so that it is easy to switch between deep atmosphere and Boussinesq.

Line plots;
- theta has a memory of the supression
- time delay before inhibition is eroded
- w< 0 cooling generally


Criteria;
>general;
- Difficult to understand differences. Just do like hovmollers, still useful as they disply 2 bits of info.
- What's the message? Add shaded region onto line plots as regions favourable to triggereing 
>2km;
- 2km is ambient air. Therefore yellow band favourable for triggering. High w, low theta.
- lifted parcel is buoyant


2-Layer;
>general
- When is upward radiation at a maximum? (speculated N1 = N2 as this has no trapping/reflection at all).
- Look for papers by Bruce Southerland ~200s for analytic solutions to "firing gravity waves at an interface"
- should look at Taylor-Goldstein equtions (and scorer parameters) - see how they relate to my equations
- Likely to go in discussion. Perhaps 1 figure.
>Seeds;
- use c seeder given by SDG
- "don't spend long getting these seeds, no one will be bothered how you've got them. Likely to be 1 line in thesis, let alone paper". 
- small number of values, may as well try every c, see where it is close to 0, and use these values to initialise (don't really understand this?!)

Paper;
- Overall message: Convective adjustment is sensitive to gravity waves (not surprising - but we have amplitude). At what point do we see a big difference?
- bulk of manuscript written with constant N. 
- Using 2 N's, find scenario of maximum upward radiation. Compare this with lidded (or 0 radiation!). Inspect tropospheric response.

Rotation
- DP eager to get onto. 
- Hopeful of analytic solution for lidded case. Unsure of it's use, for discussion at later date. Gill has similar solution.

Coupling;
- DP: Something with Lorenz equations and a switch forcing? "whole family of interesting problems".  Discuss later. 
- Another problem is analytic solutions to Rossby adjustment at the equator? Mapes has some numerical stuff.
