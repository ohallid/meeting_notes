Meeting 16/11/2015
Both SDG and DP present.

Presented Document on Convergence of Solution. 

RMS and Difference plots;
-SDG; Error seems high, lost Q? Shouldn't matter about Q though, given definition. Choose 1 value for w_0?
-Get Heating to be roughly 10^-3 K s^-1. 
-May have strict relative error. DP; could do rms of top / rms of bottom of eq.30 ?


Fourier Coeficient plots;
-Both SDG and DP knew that structure would happen.
-Should do Fourier Coefficient against wavenumber, then express group velocity in terms of that wavenumber (?). 
-Look at Fourier coefficients for fundamental wavenumber. 

Group Speed;
-Compare vertical wavenumber against horizontal
-How does \sigma come into \delta t?

Hovmollers;
-PT, semi-infinate vs lid, does this make a difference? 
-3 levels; trapped, intermediate lid, semi-infinate. Intermediate may be some model which see a lid at, say 50km.
-Get numbers for temp difference, and therefore CAPE.


General;
-Good to do work dimensionless, but need to do it with numbers simultaneously. 
-Read more, take a few days to get up to speed.
-DP; Should average a paper a day (?!?!?!?!)


To Do;
-Write a draft thesis chapter (~20 pages), answer question in transfer report. lit review. 
-Put this to bed, do a good job, then move onto 2-layer.  
-Present data in accesable way. Start off with stills from movies, then hovmollers, then specific time and explore parameter space.
