Meeting 7th Apr 2016
SDG only
Discussed: EGU poster, Energy flux problem (stratified), wave speeds

Wave speeds;
> Learn details of NR scheme, wave-speed calcs, order of convergence, etc
> 100 modes for each Ht may be too many - small contribution from each mode, therefore may not see any errors. Probably not any errors, but should check. 20 modes probably OK. 

Energy
> Don't use Gill's expression, use derived expression. See extra sheet. Derived expression has no KE term - nonlinear. 
> SDG had in mind a preliminary problem, namely fire waves at an interface, measure reflection/transmission. Can find analytic solution. See sheet. 
> integrate over time and space. Perhaps for pulse or till reach steady state. 

SDG gave poster notes on first draft.
