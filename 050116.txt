05/01/16; First meeting of 2016
Meeting to discuss draft paper
DP, SDG present

Discussed structure of Paper as well as content.

General
- Make it look like a paper as soon as possible. Add Title page, Abstract section (not necessarily written), references
- Move 3.1 (raising lid) to methods section (2). Section 3 then compares trapped vs. radiating
- Reduce white space on figures.
- b response looks wrong (too large). Q seems OK as w are realistic. Bug? b or theta?
- Can use different colour scale for difference column. Missing detail. 

Section 3, Results;
- Compare trapped vs radiating.

Intro;
- Reinstate bullet points for aims paragraph. Lost some of detail
- Aim 1: "Characteristics of gravity wave to modify/control the environmental response to convection".
- Characteristics means; vertical variation, meso-scale distribution of heating

Figure 5;
- Increase magnitude of axis spacings; missing some detail
- DP; multiply by height and some constant to get CAPE. Look at definition.
- Want to see sensitivity to lid. Plot dashed line overtop of trapped case.
- Plot or calculate CAPE from this. Give Quantative evaluation.
- Could reproduce for mid-level PT maximum and low-level w (key for triggering).

Stratification
- Would be good to have this in to compare (??!!!?!?!?!)


ORDERING
- 2   - Methods
- 3.1 - Trapped vs. Radiating: Steady Heating
			short section. "obvious" solution
- 3.2 - Trapped vs. Radiating: Transient Heating
- 3.3 - Horizontal lengthscale dependence in radiation solution
- 3.4 - Vertical structure of forcing. n=1 + n=2 modes.
- 3.5 - Stratification?
