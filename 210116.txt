Meeting 21/01/16
DP, SDG present
Discussed figures from paper. DP passed on notes from previous draft. 

General
- Merge changes from first draft. Then send second draft to SDG
- think about forcing on grid scale (how gravity waves behave on grid scale?) - not in this paper

Fig 1
- point out anomalies
- seems slow, axis mis-labelled? (yes they are)
 
Fig 5 
- comment on warm blob moving off (won't be like this for rotating note)

CAPE figures
- CAPE ~0(100) - think this is a simple scaling error (when multiplying by depth to calc the CAPE)
- general features; radiating is weaker (due to energy lost aloft) and signal progresses faster (due to the excitation of deeper modes).
- Have clear paragraph simply stating above. 
- quantify changes (e.g. 20% weaker in radiating case). SDG; "this is what people will quote from your paper". 
- add in w 

General figure comments
- no title in figures for paper, info goes in caption. (will just comment out the titles in code)
- could include table of quantitative differences. 


Low-level cooling
- look at cross section. w will be very differenct.
- look at low point of atmosphere (for effect on CIN - harder to quantify). 
- pt the same for trapped case but different in radiating. This is because it's "exciting a whole range of modes which don't necessarily integrate to 0 " (?)
